<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Mark, and this is my blog. 
I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin Madison pursuing a Masters in Environmental Studies, focusing on remote sensing classification algorithms. 
But that's not what this blog is about.</p>
<p>This blog is about all the other stuff I'm interested in. 
More specifically, it is mainly based around web development with some of my thoughts on other things sprinkled in. Of these other things, ultimate frisbee, backpacking, and Engineers Without Borders are the most likely topics.</p>

<h2>My goals for this blog</h2>
<ol>
<li>Share useful information. As a web developer, I often encounter challenges that take a surprising amount of time to overcome. However, the amount of time has been cut down drastically thanks to the countless other bloggers out there sharing very helpful posts. If I discover something that that would be useful to others, it would be a shame to not share it with the world. </li>
<li>Have a platform to talk about random things when I want. There are an estimated 100+ million blogs on the internet so it looks like I'm not the only one with this desire!</li>
<li>Put a face to the sites I write. I'm sure most of you out there would like to know who is producing the content you are consuming.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Programming is a lot of fun</h2>

<p>I have been programming for 7 years for schoolwork, research, and as a hobby. I have a BS in Computer Science and Engineering from UCLA and an MS in Computer Science from UW-Madison and am still doing a significant amount of software development in my current research position in the department of Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>Being in computer science for so long, I have acquired many technical skills that are sometimes useful. Although I'm not looking for a job right now, you are still welcome to view <a title="my resume" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2616700/mark_liu_resume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> and/or contact me if you are interested in what I have to offer.<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;amp;amp;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>My favorite language is Python by a wide margin and thus for web development I am a huge fan of the Django web framework. This site is built using Django and the source code will soon be released for you to do whatever you want with it.</p>

<h2>Ultimate frisbee is the greatest sport ever</h2>
<p>I started playing in 2003, and it doesn't look like I'll ever stop. I've played on various college teams (Burninators, <a href="http://smaugultimate.com/" title="Smaug Ultimate Frisbee">Smaug</a>, Pimpdags), club teams (SPUN, Teddy Grumpskins, Test Tickle Me Elmo), recreational league teams (<a href="http://www.mufa.org" title="Madison Ultimate Frisbee Association">MUFA</a>, <a href="http://www.laout.org/" title="Los Angeles Organization of Ultimate Teams">LAOUT</a>), single tournament teams (at events like Potlatch), and of course intramural teams. Every single one was a ton of fun.</p>

<h2>I like backpacking too</h2>
<p>There is nothing as refreshing as being days removed from technology and all our usual daily routines. As much as I love computers and programming, I feel like it makes me even more appreciative of getting outside, breathing fresh air, and leaving all my usual worries behind.</p>
<p>In 2009 I luckily had enough free time to hike the entire 210 mile John Muir Trail in one go. It was absolutely beautiful. You can view pictures of it <a title="here" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2568692&amp;id=2528030&amp;l=c13062deba" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="here" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2572167&amp;id=2528030&amp;l=41c8693a55" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a title="here" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2572172&amp;id=2528030&amp;l=da25daa3e8" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


<h2>Engineers Without Borders is a great organization</h2>
<p>
Since 2008, I have been heavily involved in the UW-Madison chapter of Engineers Without Borders.
I have been fortunate enough to travel to Kenya on several occasions for three weeks at a time including our project's first two assessment trips.
These adventures really opened my eyes to the world and I honestly don't know where I would be without the experiences EWB has given me.
</p>
<p>
I was the project manager for our chapter's <a href="http://www.ewbuw.org/node/20?project_id=1" title="UW-Madison Engineers Without Borders Kenya Project">Kenya project</a> for one year, which taught me an incredible amount about leadership and dealing with people.
The cultural differences between our Kenyan contacts and ourselves are often very challenging, and have helped me to become much more open-minded.
Although I am no longer the project manager, I know the project is in good hands and I intend to stay very active in the project for as long as I am in Madison.

I've uploaded several photos from my January 2010 trip to facebook which you can view <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2633309&id=2528030&l=c8dcca5425" title="EWB Kenya Photos 2010">here</a>. I uploaded a lot more pictures from our very first trip in albums <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2381863&id=2528030&l=08fc7e3b8d" title="EWB Kenya Photos">here</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2382158&id=2528030&l=d460b48cfd" title="EWB Kenya Photos">here</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2382174&id=2528030&l=2c9ddf6cec" title="EWB Kenya Photos">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2382234&id=2528030&l=d535b005a4" title="EWB Kenya Photos">here</a>.

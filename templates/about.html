<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Mark, and this is my blog. 
I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin Madison pursuing a Masters in Environmental Studies, focusing on remote sensing classification algorithms. 
But that's not what this blog is about.</p>
<p>This blog is about the other stuff I'm interested in. 
Mostly web development, ultimate frisbee, backpacking, and Engineers Without Borders.</p>

<h2>My goals for this blog</h2>
<ol>
<li>Share useful information. As a web developer, I often encounter challenges that take a surprising amount of time. Thanks to the countless other bloggers out there, endless numbers of solutions to problems have already been posted and have saved me countless hours. If I solve something that has not been documented well, it would be a shame to not share it with the world. </li>
<li>Have a platform to talk about random things when I want. There are an estimated 100+ million blogs on the internet so it looks like I'm not the only one with this desire!</li>
<li>Put a face to the sites I write. I'm sure most of you out there would like to know who is producing the content you are consuming. I hope this blog helps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h2>I like Backpacking</h2>

<p>There is nothing as refreshing as being days removed from technology and all our usual daily routines. As much as I love computers and programming, I feel like it makes me even more appreciative of getting outside, breathing fresh air, and leaving all my usual worries behind.</p>
<p>In 2009 I luckily had enough free time to hike the entire 210 mile John Muir Trail in one go. It was absolutely beautiful. You can view pictures of it <a title="here" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2568692&amp;id=2528030&amp;l=c13062deba" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="here" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2572167&amp;id=2528030&amp;l=41c8693a55" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a title="here" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2572172&amp;id=2528030&amp;l=da25daa3e8" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Ultimate frisbee is the greatest sport ever</h2>
<p>I started playing in 2003, and it doesn't look like I'll ever stop. I've played on various college teams (Burninators, Smaug, Pimpdags), club teams (SPUN, Teddy Grumpskins, Test Tickle Me Elmo), recreational league teams (MUFA, LAOUT), single tournament teams (at events like Potlatch), and of course intramural teams. Every single one was a ton of fun.</p>

<h2>Programming is fun too</h2>

<p>I have been programming for 7 years for schoolwork, research, and as a hobby. I have a BS in Computer Science and Engineering from UCLA and an MS in Computer Science from UW-Madison and am still doing a significant amount of software development in my current research position in the department of Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>Being in computer science for so long, I have acquired many technical skills that are sometimes useful. Although I'm not looking for a job right now, you are still welcome to view <a title="my resume" href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2616700/mark_liu_resume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> and/or contact me if you are interested in what I have to offer.<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &amp;amp;amp;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>My favorite language is Python by a wide margin and thus for web development I am a huge fan of the Django web framework. This site is built using Django and the source code will soon be released for you to do whatever you want with it.</p>

<p>Engineers Without Borders changed my life</p>
